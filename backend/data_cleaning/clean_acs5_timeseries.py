**Description**:
    Cleaning for the ACS-5 timeseries tables derived from the raw
    `demographics`, `economic`, `housing`, `acs5_economic` and `acs5_housing`
    DuckLake tables:

    Cleaning Steps:
    1. Numeric -6666666 (UNAVALILABLE) turned into NA,
    2. Column "county_subdivision" renamed to "town"
    3. Columns "geoid" and "county_fips" are merged in.

**Run ALL datasets**:
python run_data_cleaning.py clean_acs5_timeseries

**Run only a SUBSET** (from Python):
main(con, ["median_age", "vacancy_rate"])

    tenure, the 30.0-34.9% and 35.0%+ household counts (Measure = 'Estimate')
    are summed and divided by the tenure's Total (households where the
    percentage can be computed). Counts are used rather than the published
    percentages because their labels are stable across years (percentages are
    'Percent Estimate' in 2017-2018) and because they can be summed into an
    "All households" row.

    Every negative Census sentinel and any non-numeric value is NULL before
    summing, so two missing brackets never add up to a value. A tenure row is
    NULL unless both brackets and the Total are present exactly once; "All
    households" is NULL unless all three tenures are complete. Percent is NULL
    when the universe is 0 (no households of that tenure).
