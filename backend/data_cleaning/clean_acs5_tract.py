"""
**Description**:
    Tract-level poverty and health-insurance indicators from RAW.acs5_tract
    (see data_collection/acs5_tract.py), for pairing with CDC PLACES tracts.

    Each indicator is a share (count / universe) with a 90% margin of error,
    derived with the Census Bureau's formulas for sums (root sum of squared
    MOEs) and proportions. Census sentinels (negative estimates) and any
    missing component make the indicator NULL instead of a partial sum.

    Writes lake.CLEANED.acs5_tract_tidy: year, geoid, county_fips, county,
    name, geo_type, section, variable, value (count), universe, percent,
    percent_moe.
